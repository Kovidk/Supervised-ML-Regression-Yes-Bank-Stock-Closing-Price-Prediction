Machine Learning models
Developed a regression model using algorithms such as *Linear Regression *Lasso Regression *Ridge Regression *ElasticNet Regression. All four models have good R2 and Adjusted R2.

Conclusion
Ridge and ElasticNet have performed far much better after Cross-validation where the adjusted R2 is about 98.99% and 98.99% respectively.

All deployed models exhibited impressive results on our data, yielding an Adjusted R-squared exceeding 99%.
